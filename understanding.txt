High-Level Overview: Portfolio Platform vs Trading Engine

1. Purpose of Each System
-------------------------
- Portfolio Platform (Research, Strategy, Oversight)
  * The "brain" of the operation.
  * Gathers historical and live market data (prices, fundamentals, alternative data).
  * Runs research, machine learning models, and optimization services.
  * Generates trading signals, portfolio targets, and recommendations.
  * Focuses on accuracy, compliance, auditability, and strategic insight.
  * Operates at slower speeds (minutes, hours, or daily updates).

- Trading Engine (Execution)
  * The "muscle" of the operation.
  * Consumes trade instructions (buy/sell X shares of stock Y).
  * Connects directly to exchanges or brokers via FIX/WebSocket APIs.
  * Maintains real-time order books and market data in memory.
  * Executes trades with minimal latency (milliseconds).
  * Focuses on speed, precision, and order management.
  * Does not run heavy analytics â€“ only acts on signals and manages orders.

2. Data Flow Between Systems
----------------------------
- Market Data:
  * Trading engine subscribes directly to real-time feeds from exchanges or brokers.
  * Keeps a constantly updated in-memory order book (bids, asks, volumes).
  * Does not rely on databases for speed.

- Portfolio Data:
  * Portfolio platform calculates targets or trade ideas using research/ML models.
  * Publishes instructions to the trading engine via messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or APIs.
  * Example: "Buy 200 AAPL, Sell 150 MSFT."

3. Execution and Feedback Loop
------------------------------
1. Portfolio platform identifies opportunity and sends trade idea.
2. Trading engine receives idea and checks live market data.
3. Orders are routed to exchanges using execution algorithms (VWAP, TWAP, etc.).
4. Exchange confirms fills (e.g., 200 AAPL at $150.12).
5. Trading engine updates positions in memory and reports execution back to:
   - Portfolio platform (for holdings, compliance, risk updates).
   - Dashboards and oversight systems (for visibility and audit).

4. Opportunity Lifecycles
-------------------------
- Portfolio platform defines signal lifetimes based on research and backtesting.
- Trading engine enforces exit conditions in real time (stop-loss, target profit, time expiry).
- Opportunity closes when:
  * Prices converge (mispricing corrected).
  * New market information invalidates signal.
  * Predefined time/risk conditions are met.

5. Why This Architecture Works
------------------------------
- Separation of Concerns:
  * Portfolio platform = slower but smarter (strategy, models, oversight).
  * Trading engine = faster but narrower (execution only).
- Scalability:
  * Portfolio layer scales with data and analytics.
  * Execution layer scales with low-latency performance optimizations.
- Enterprise-Grade Reliability:
  * Full audit trails, SLA monitoring, fallback systems in portfolio layer.
  * High-speed execution with redundancy in trading engine layer.
- Real-World Alignment:
  * Mirrors institutional setups: PMS (Portfolio Management System) vs OMS/EMS (Order/Execution Management Systems).

6. Key Takeaway
---------------
The portfolio platform provides the intelligence ("what to trade, why, and how much").
The trading engine provides the speed ("how to trade it efficiently in the market").
Together, they form a complete enterprise-level trading and portfolio management ecosystem.
